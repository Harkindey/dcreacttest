<h1>Question 1 : How long did you spend on the code test?</h1>
    <h2>It took me about 2 hours to achieve the design and structure of the whole app and some clean ups and perfomance checking made it 3 hours, I normally work would faster when designs are given.</h2>
<h1>Question 2 : What went well?</h1>
    <h2>Everything did, the design and planning<h2>
<h1>Question 3 : Was there anything that was attempted but was not possible to get working in the time so is not visible in the code? </h1>
    <h2>I knew using a state management tool like flux/redux would be killing a mosquito with a machine gun. react props and state did the job</h2>
<h1>Question 4: What would you do to improve it / continue development?</h1>
    <h2>Maybe change the API i feel it is slow, and if there are more endpoints, i can make it more interactive, maybe include Flux/Redux then, cause there will be lot of state to manage. <h2>
